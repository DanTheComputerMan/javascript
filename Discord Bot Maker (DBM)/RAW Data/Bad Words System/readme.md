# THIS COMMAND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING NODE MODULE TO WORK:
`quick.db` If you don't have this, open up your command prompt / cmd.exe and type both of these:
```js
npm i quick.db@7.0.0-b21
```
If you're *still* having issues with it, run this and wait (it takes awhile), then install `npm i quick.db@7.0.0-b21` again:
```js
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
